## HTML + Css Basics: Udacity ( Watching and action )
I will be using other free resources such as freecodecamp and udacity to help teach you a little bit more about html and what it is. Udacity learning style is to show a video and then do some sort of action after. If this sounds like you then i recommend the below

 - if you head to this link: [Intro-to-html-and-css](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud001)
 - sign up and follow the guide for Intro to HTML and CSS
 - If you can put the speed up to 1.25 or 1.5 as it will quicken the video
    - Now the study will be up to you! you are more than welcome to do only the first one and move on thats fine. I recommend finishing up to the thrid lesson as it covers both html and css.
 - we will be runnng this lesson over the next two days so there is no need to rush. 

## HTML + Css Basics: FreeCodeCamp ( Coding and reading )
However if you want to use more coding and reading then FreeCodeCamp is the one for you. As a reminder i did both. you are more than welcome to do both they cover the same things just in a different way

1. Sign up to freeCodeCamp using your GitHub login.
